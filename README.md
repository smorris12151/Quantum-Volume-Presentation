# Quantum-Volume-Presentation
The slides found in the PDF aptly labeled "Quantum Volume Slides" are from a presentation I gave with a classmate of mine, discussing a novel metric for Quantum Computation as presented in the paper ["Validating quantum computers using randomized model circuits" by Cross et al](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.12926) at the IBM Research Center.

The paper is highly readable, and highly recommended! Alternatively, check out our slides for the cliff notes :o)

Thanks for looking!
